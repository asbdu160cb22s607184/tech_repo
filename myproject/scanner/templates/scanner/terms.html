    The API is here for your own use and convenience, and we ask that you don't do anything to disrupt the service, the use of the service, or other services.

    <br>
    <br>
    If you'd like to use our service as part of another product or service you offer, sometimes known as "white-labelling", please contact us as we have a specific product to allow use of our scanning engine in this way: enterprise@securityheaders.com
